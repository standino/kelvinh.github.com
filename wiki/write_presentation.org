#+DESCRIPTION:  How to Write Good Presentations



* How to Write Presentation

** Write the presentation in muse

Below is a sample

<include file="../article/template.muse" markup="#+BEGIN_SRC " >

** Use [[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html][yEd Graph Editor]] to draw the diagram 

yEd is a powerful diagram editor that can be used to quickly and effectively generate high-quality drawings of diagrams. 

** Publish with my-slides in Muse


----
I have configured my emacs with muse to write presentations. 
And I can use Tikz tag to display some pictures writing in pgf code.
This is a [[/home/will/book/tex/pgfmanualCVS2008-12-01.pdf][good book]] for Tizk


* Tools

 -[[index][Emacs]]
 -Muse
 -[[beamer][Beamer]]

* [[http://www.texample.net/tikz/][TikZ and PGF]]

** Path

The basic building block of all pictures in Tik Z is the path. A path is a series of straight lines and curves
that are connected (that is not the whole picture, but let us ignore the complications for the moment). You
start a path by specifying the coordinates of the start position as a point in round brackets, as in (0,0).
This is followed by a series of “path extension operations.” The simplest is --, which we used already. It
must be followed by another coordinate and it extends the path in a straight line to this new position. 

** Curved Path

The general syntax for extending a path in a “curved” way is .. controls first control point and
 second control point .. end point . You can leave out the and second control point , which causes the
first one to be used twice.

To include the encoded file in your document:

o Include a line in your document preamble:
    \usepackage{lgrind}
  or, if you want the code to include function labels on the right
  hand side, 
    \usepackage[procnames,noindent]{lgrind}

o Place the lines

   \begin{lgrind}
   \input mycode.tex
   \end{lgrind}

  in your .tex file where you want to insert the formatted code.

*  Use beamer to build presentation
